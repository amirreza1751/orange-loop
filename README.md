    Question 3 - Resource-Limited Decision Making
</h2>
<p>
    According to multi-threading programming concepts, considering that the two tasks do not depend on each other, we are able to execute each of them in two separate threads. In case of having a single core CPU, the Operating System (OS) adopts concurrency to create time slices and allocates the resource to one task in each time slice. By using this approach, we are able to complete the both tasks in an overlapping time.
    In case of having a multi core CPU, the OS manages to assign at least one core to each thread. In this case, we parallelized the process, and both tasks will be completed in 2 hours.
